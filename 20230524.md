  - Tree : visualizing a hierarchical structure
  - Subtree : part of a tree, starting at a new root(first) and ending at the leaves(last)
  - Root : the FIRST node in a tree or subtree ; ex) root layout
  - Leaf : nodes in a subtree that have NO CHILDREN ; ex) the last segment in a URL path

  - URL Segment: part of the URL path delimited by slashes
  - URL Path: part of the URL that comes after the domain ( composed of segments)
  
  ### The ```app``` Directory
  It supports shared layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling and more. 
  It works alongside the ```pages``` directory to allow for incremental adoption
  ( Priority : the App Router > the Pages Router)
   By default, components inside app are ~~React Server Components~~ but can also use Client Components

   ### Nested Routes

   ### File Conventions

   ### Component Hierarchy
