# Routing Fundamentals
## terminology 
[](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fterminology-component-tree.png&w=3840&q=75)
  - Tree: a convention for visualizing a hierarchical structure
  - Subtree : part of a tree, starting at a new root(first) and ending at the leaves(last)
  - Root : the FIRST node in a tree or subtree
  ex) root layout 
  - Leaf : nodes in a subtree that have NO CHILDREN
  ex) the last segment in a URL path

  - URL Segment : part of the URL path delimited by slashes
  - URL Path : part of the URL that comes after the domain(composed of segments)

## the app directory 
: the App Router takes priority over the Pages Router; Routes across directories should not resolve to the same URL path

## Roles of Folders and Files
- folders are used to define routes. -> more: ```Defining routes```
- files are used to create UI that is shown for a route segment

## Route Segments
: each folder in a route represents a route segment( each route segment is mapped to a corresponding segment in a URL path)

## Nested Routes
: to create a nested route, nest folders inside each other

## File Conventions ( a set of special files to create UI with specific behaviour in nested routes)
- layout : shared UI
- page : unique UI of a route and make routes publicily accessible
- loading : loading UI
- not-found : not found UI
- error : error UI
- global-error : global error UI
- route : server-side API endpoint
- template : specialized re-rendered Layout UI
- default : fallback UI for ```Parallel Routes```

## Component Hierarchy
```html
<Layout>
  <Template>
    <ErrorBoundary fallback={<Error/>}>
      <Suspense fallback={ <Loading/>}>
        <ErrorBoundary fallback={<NotFound/>}>
          <Page/>
        </ErrorBoundary>
      </Suspense>
    </ErrorBoundary>
  </Template>
</Layout>
```

## Colocation
: option to colocate files inside folders in the app directory
(while folders define routes, **only the contents returned by page.js or route.js are publically addressable**)

## Server-Centric Routing with Client-side Navigation
- unlike the pages directory which uses client-side routing, the App Router uses server-centric routing to align with Server Components and data fetching on the server
=> the client doesn't have to download a route map and the same request
- although routing is sever-centric, the router uses client-side navigation with the <Link/> :resembling the behavior of a SPA 
=> means when a user navigates to a new route, the browser will not reload the page, instead the URL will be updated and Next.js will only render the segments that change
- as users navigate around the app, the router will store the result of the React Server Component payload in an **in-memory client-side cache**. 
=> means the cache of a previously fetched segment can be re-used, further improving performance -> more: ```Linking and Navigating```

## Partial Rendering
- when navigating between sibling routes, next.js will only fetch and render the layouts and pages in routes that change. It will not re-fetch or re-render anything above the segments in the subtree
=> means routes that share a layout will be preserved
=> reduces the amount of data transferred and execution time, leading to improved performance.

## Advanced Routing Patterns
- ### Parellel Routes : show two or more pages simultaneously in the same view that can be navigated independently ( can use for split views - dashboards)
- ### Intercepting Routes : allow to intercept a route and show it in the context of another route( can use when keeping the context for the current page is important - seeing all tasks while editing one task or expanding a photo in a feed)
